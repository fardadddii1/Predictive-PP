# calculate Charlson Comorbidty Index and Ischemic Stroke Comorbity Index in Python
### This repository contains codes for calculating Charlson Comorbidty Index and Ischemic Stroke Comorbity Index

*Prepared by Fardad Mpusavi at SUNY Buffalo, Dec. 2021*

It is programmed to account for hierarchical calcualtion of the scores, from reference paper

" Calculation of the maximum score is based on a hierarchy where diabetes with complications supersedes diabetes without complications; moderate or severe liver disease supersedes mild liver disease; and metastatic solid tumor supersedes any malignancy"

The file is based on ICD-10-CM codes, but works with ICD-10 as well

Functions are reapting saving values so you can change comorbidity wieghts  and claculate your own index
For ISchaemic Stroke comorbidity weights I used Table 2 of https://bit.ly/3PfhKEz 

The scores have been validated with clinicians to ensure the accuracy
